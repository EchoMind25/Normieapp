  NEW ISSUES DISCOVERED

  NEW ISSUE #1: Missing Camera Privacy Description

  Severity: ❌ HIGH (Will cause App Store rejection)
  Location: ios/App/App/Info.plist

  Issue: The app includes CapacitorCamera plugin but Info.plist is missing required privacy descriptions:
  - NSCameraUsageDescription - MISSING
  - NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription - MISSING

  Impact: Apple will REJECT the app if camera/photo features are used without these descriptions.

  Fix Required: Add to ios/App/App/Info.plist:
  <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
  <string>This app uses the camera to capture photos for your profile and memes.</string>
  <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
  <string>This app accesses your photo library to select images for your profile and memes.</string>

  NEW ISSUE #2: Minimum iOS Version Too Low

  Severity: ⚠️ MEDIUM
  Location: ios/App/Podfile:3

  Issue: Platform is set to iOS 14.0:
  platform :ios, '14.0'

  Recommendation: Update to iOS 15.0+ for better feature support and reduced support burden.

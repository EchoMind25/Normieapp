Here's an updated prompt for Replit's Autonomous Agent. I've incorporated code ideas from React meme generator tutorials (e.g., using Fabric.js for canvas with draggable images from an array of external URLs, mapping through stickers in a gallery component with img tags that become draggable on canvas, and ensuring html2canvas for export). For stickers, it pulls from free transparent PNG sources like stickpng.com (e.g., Angry Pepe, Sad Pepe variants) to match your themes—agent will download/import them to assets. Added instructions for prominent display (opacity=1, optional borders/shadows) and default background (e.g., light gray with placeholder text like "Drag to start your meme").

Fix the Meme Generator in Normie Nation app (all-in-one memecoin hub with live dashboard, NFT marketplace, art gallery, user profiles, authentication, admin controls for Normie CEO, live streaming, encrypted/public chats, and PostgreSQL DB) to import external stickers instead of generating them. Switch from AI generation to sourcing free transparent PNG Pepe-themed stickers from sites like https://www.stickpng.com/cat/memes/pepe-the-frog (e.g., Angry Pepe, Sad Pepe, Crying Pepe, etc.) or https://www.pngegg.com/en/search?q=pepe. Download 10-15 variants and add to assets folder (or use direct URLs with CORS handling).
Key updates:

Import Stickers Code: Use Fabric.js for the canvas (install via npm if needed: npm i fabric). In MemeGenerator.js, create a sticker gallery: Map through an array of sticker URLs/objects like const stickers = [{src: 'https://www.stickpng.com/img/download/5c8a5b5b5b5b5b0001b5b5b5/angry-pepe', name: 'Angry Pepe'}, ...]; Render as [image] in a grid, make draggable to canvas via fabric.Image.fromURL(src, img => { canvas.add(img.set({left: 100, top: 100, scaleX: 1.5, scaleY: 1.5, opacity: 1})); }). Allow resize/rotate.
Prominent Sticker Display: Set opacity: 1 on all added stickers/emojis. Add CSS for contrast (e.g., box-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.5); border: 1px solid #fff if needed) to ensure visibility on any background/uploaded image. Test on dark/light/user-uploaded backgrounds.
Default Background: On initial load (if no background set), use a light gray canvas (#f0f0f0) with centered placeholder text: "Upload background or drag stickers to start your Normie meme!" (use fabric.Text). Remove once user interacts (e.g., on first upload/drag).
PRD Alignments: Integrate with art gallery for user uploads (store PNG paths in PostgreSQL, admin approval via Normie dashboard). Add text overlays/filters/templates for extensive features. Tie to authentication (save memes to profiles), live data (overlay token price), and share to chats/X.

Provide code diffs for MemeGenerator.js (add Fabric.js init, sticker array, drag handlers), update package.json, and test for mobile/responsiveness. Deploy and verify: Stickers import correctly, appear prominent, default background shows initially.

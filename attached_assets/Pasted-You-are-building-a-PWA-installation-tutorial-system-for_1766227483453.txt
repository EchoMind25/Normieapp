You are building a PWA installation tutorial system for normie.observer (a Solana memecoin tracking web app).

CONTEXT:
- normie.observer is a real-time Solana memecoin tracking platform
- Already deployed as a web app, needs to guide users to install as PWA
- Users access from iOS Safari, Android Chrome, and Desktop Chrome/Edge
- Must detect device/browser and show only relevant installation steps

YOUR TASK:
Build a production-ready PWA installation tutorial system with:

1. Smart overlay that auto-detects browser/device
2. Dedicated /install page with tabbed instructions
3. Device-specific installation guides (iOS, Android, Desktop)
4. Dismissible prompts with localStorage tracking
5. Native install prompt integration where supported

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

**Detection Logic:**
- Detect iOS Safari vs Android Chrome vs Desktop Chrome/Edge
- Check if PWA already installed (don't show if installed)
- Capture `beforeinstallprompt` event for native install
- Track dismissals (don't spam users)

**Smart Overlay Features:**
- Auto-show on first visit (if PWA not installed)
- Position: bottom-right corner, non-intrusive
- Dismissible with "Got it" or "Not now" button
- Remember dismissal for 7 days
- Show device-specific instructions only

**Dedicated /install Page:**
- Tabbed interface (iOS | Android | Desktop)
- Auto-select correct tab based on detected device
- Step-by-step instructions with placeholder for screenshots
- Clean, minimal design matching normie.observer aesthetic
- Responsive layout

**Platform-Specific Instructions:**

iOS Safari:
1. Tap Share button in Safari
2. Scroll and tap "Add to Home Screen"
3. Tap "Add"

Android Chrome:
1. Use native install prompt if available
2. Fallback: Tap menu → "Install app" or "Add to Home Screen"

Desktop Chrome/Edge:
1. Click install icon in address bar
2. Or: Menu → "Install Normie Observer"

DELIVERABLES:

**File Structure:**
/public
/install-tutorial
pwa-installer.js       (detection + overlay logic)
install-page.html      (dedicated tutorial page)
styles.css            (overlay + page styles)
/icons                    (placeholder comments for screenshot paths)

**Code Requirements:**
- Pure JavaScript (no framework dependencies for installer)
- Mobile-first responsive CSS
- Accessible (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- <500KB total bundle size
- Works offline (if service worker active)

**localStorage Schema:**
```javascript
{
  "installPromptDismissed": timestamp,
  "installPromptShownCount": number,
  "userInstalledPWA": boolean
}
```

**Integration Instructions:**
Provide clear steps to integrate into existing normie.observer codebase:
1. Where to place files
2. How to import/initialize
3. Required HTML updates
4. Manifest.json validation checklist
5. Testing steps for each platform

CONSTRAINTS:
- No external dependencies (no jQuery, no React for this feature)
- Must work with existing service worker (don't create new one)
- Respect user privacy (no tracking beyond dismissal state)
- Graceful degradation (if PWA not supported, show simple instructions)
- Match normie.observer's dark theme aesthetic

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

First Visit (PWA not installed):
→ Detect device → Show relevant overlay → User dismisses or installs

Revisit (dismissed, not installed):
→ Don't show overlay for 7 days → Provide link to /install page in nav/settings

Already Installed:
→ Detect standalone mode → Hide all install prompts

TESTING CHECKLIST:
Provide instructions to test on:
- iPhone/iPad Safari (real device + simulator)
- Android Chrome (real device + emulator)
- Desktop Chrome (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Desktop Edge
- Verify dismissal persistence
- Verify "already installed" detection

OUTPUT FORMAT:
1. Complete code files (copy-paste ready)
2. Integration guide (where to add to normie.observer)
3. Testing instructions for each platform
4. Screenshot placeholder locations (I'll add images later)
5. Troubleshooting common issues

Build this as production-ready code, not a tutorial or example. Assume normie.observer has:
- Valid manifest.json
- Service worker registered
- HTTPS enabled
- Current dark theme with #00ff88 accent color

Start with the smart overlay implementation, then build the dedicated /install page.

Shorter version if Replit handles context well:
Build a production PWA installation tutorial for normie.observer.

Requirements:
- Smart overlay (auto-detect iOS/Android/Desktop, show relevant steps)
- Dedicated /install page with tabs
- localStorage dismissal tracking (7-day cooldown)
- Native install prompt integration
- Dark theme, #00ff88 accent
- No external dependencies

Deliverables:
1. pwa-installer.js (detection + overlay)
2. /install page (tabbed instructions)
3. Integration guide
4. Testing checklist

Detect: iOS Safari, Android Chrome, Desktop Chrome/Edge
Track: Don't spam dismissed users, hide if already installed
Design: Bottom-right overlay, non-intrusive, mobile-responsive

Provide copy-paste ready code + integration steps.

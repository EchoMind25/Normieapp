  SUMMARY

  The normie.observer web application is well-built with proper legal compliance, security measures, and a comprehensive database schema. However, iOS submission is blocked because the Capacitor iOS platform has not been initialized.

  The single most important action needed:
  npm install @capacitor/cli@8 && npx cap add ios && npx cap sync ios

  Once the iOS project is created, the developer must:
  1. Open ios/App/App.xcworkspace in Xcode
  2. Add app icons (1024x1024 required)
  3. Configure signing with Apple Developer account
  4. Test on iOS Simulator
  5. Submit via App Store Connect

  The web application itself is ready for wrapping - it just needs the native container to be created.

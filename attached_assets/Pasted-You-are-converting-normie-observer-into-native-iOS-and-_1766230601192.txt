You are converting normie.observer into native iOS and Android applications for App Store and Google Play submission.

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
- normie.observer is a Solana memecoin/NFT tracking and community platform
- Currently a web app with real-time price charts, NFT browsing, community features
- Goal: Official native apps for iOS (App Store) and Android (Play Store)
- Future roadmap: NFT purchases, crypto wallet integration, Apple Pay support
- Must comply with Apple's strict crypto/NFT policies and Google Play guidelines

COMPLIANCE-FIRST APPROACH:

**Phase 1 Apps (Initial Submission - SAFEST):**
- NFT viewing/browsing (NOT purchasing)
- Price tracking and charts (informational only)
- Community features (forums, profiles, following)
- Educational content about Solana NFTs
- Wallet address tracking (view-only)
- Push notifications for price alerts
- NO in-app purchases of crypto/NFTs initially

**Phase 2 (Post-Approval via Update):**
- External wallet integration (MetaMask, Phantom)
- NFT purchases through connected wallets (NOT Apple IAP)
- Crypto transactions (with proper disclaimers)
- Apple Pay integration (if approved for fiat on-ramp only)

YOUR TASK:
Build production-ready native iOS and Android apps optimized for App Store/Play Store approval.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

**Platform Choice:**
Choose ONE and justify:
- React Native (if normie.observer is React-based)
- Flutter (better performance for charts/animations)
- Native Swift/Kotlin (maximum approval odds but 2x dev work)

/services
api.js              (connect to normie.observer backend)

**App Review Strategy:**

**Reviewer Notes to Include:**
This app provides informational price tracking for Solana-based NFTs and memecoins.
Key Points:

NO cryptocurrency or NFT purchases are available in-app
All pricing data is for informational/educational purposes only
Community features are moderated with reporting functionality
Users must be 17+ due to financial information
External links to third-party marketplaces clearly disclosed
App does not facilitate trading or financial transactions

Test Account:
Username: reviewer@normie.observer
Password: [provide secure password]
Demo Video: [link to unlisted YouTube walkthrough]

**Rejection Risk Mitigation:**

High-risk features to avoid initially:
- ANY in-app crypto purchases
- Wallet private key storage
- Price predictions/financial advice
- Unmoderated user content
- External payment processing
- Referral/reward programs
- Gambling-adjacent features

If rejected, common reasons and fixes:
- **4.3 Design: Spam** → Add more native features, reduce web wrapper feel
- **3.1.1 In-App Purchase** → Remove all purchase flows, make view-only
- **5.2.1 User Generated Content** → Add robust moderation/reporting
- **5.3 Gaming, Gambling** → Tone down "trading" language, emphasize education

**Code Structure Example:**
```swift
// iOS - Compliance-first design
struct NFTDetailView: View {
    let nft: NFTModel
    
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            // Risk disclaimer at top
            DisclaimerBanner(
                text: "Price information is for educational purposes only. Not financial advice."
            )
            
            NFTImageView(url: nft.imageUrl)
            PriceChart(data: nft.priceHistory)
            
            // NO BUY BUTTON in Phase 1
            Button("View on External Marketplace") {
                // Opens Safari, not in-app purchase
                openExternalURL(nft.marketplaceUrl)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Performance Targets:**

- App launch: <2 seconds cold, <1 second warm
- Chart rendering: 60fps minimum
- API response caching: 5-minute TTL
- Image loading: Progressive, cached
- Memory footprint: <150MB typical usage
- Battery impact: "Low" in iOS battery settings
- Crash rate: <0.1% (App Store threshold is 1%)

**Monitoring & Compliance:**

Implement analytics (privacy-compliant):
- Screen view tracking
- Feature usage metrics
- Crash reporting (Firebase, Sentry)
- Performance monitoring
- User retention rates

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:**

1. **Don't Look Like a WebView:**
   - Use native navigation patterns
   - Implement native gestures
   - Use platform-specific UI components
   - Offline functionality
   - Push notifications

2. **Prove Educational Value:**
   - Add "Learn" section about Solana/NFTs
   - Glossary of terms
   - Market analysis (informational only)
   - Risk education

3. **Show Content Moderation:**
   - Visible "Report" buttons
   - Community guidelines
   - Moderator response times
   - User blocking functionality

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**

Provide:
1. Complete native app codebase (iOS + Android)
2. App Store/Play Store metadata files (ready to copy-paste)
3. Screenshot templates with annotations
4. Privacy Policy + Terms of Service (legal-compliant)
5. Submission checklist for both platforms
6. Reviewer notes document
7. Demo video script
8. Post-approval roadmap (how to add wallet features safely)

**CONSTRAINTS:**

- Do NOT include actual crypto purchase functionality in v1.0
- Do NOT use private APIs or undocumented features
- Do NOT make financial predictions or investment advice
- Do NOT store user private keys/seed phrases
- Do NOT bypass platform payment systems (no Stripe for NFTs)
- Target minimum iOS 15.0, Android API 26 (Oreo)
- Bundle size under 100MB (initial download)
- Support both phones and tablets

Start with the iOS implementation first (stricter approval process), then adapt for Android. Focus on features that demonstrate value beyond a web wrapper while maintaining strict compliance with App Store guidelines 3.1.1 and 5.2.1.

Build this as if we're submitting tomorrow - production-ready, legally compliant, and optimized for first-time approval.
